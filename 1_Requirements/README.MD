# INTRODUCTION
 Snakes and ladders is a board game for two or more players that is considered a worldwide classic today. The game, known as Moksha Patam in ancient India, was introduced to the United Kingdom in the 1890s. It is played on a gridded game board with numbered squares. On the board, several "ladders" and "snakes" are depicted, each linking two different board squares. The goal of the game is to manoeuvre one's game piece from the start (bottom square) to the end (top square) using die rolls, aided by climbing ladders but hampered by tumbling down snakes.

# OBJECTIVE 
 The grid size varies, but it is usually 88, 1010, or 12*12 squares. Snakes and ladders start and end on different squares on the boards, which affects the length of play. Each player is represented by his or her own game piece token. In the classic mode of play, a single die is rolled to determine the random movement of a player's token; two dice may be used for a shorter game.

# MATHEMATICS OF THE GAME
 A player will require 39.2 spins on average to go from the starting position, which is off the board, to square 100. A two-person game is anticipated to conclude in 47.76 moves, with the first player having a 50.9 percent probability of winning. These calculations are based on a version in which throwing a six does not result in an additional roll, and the player must roll the precise number to reach square 100, and if they overshoot, their counter does not progress.

#RESULT
